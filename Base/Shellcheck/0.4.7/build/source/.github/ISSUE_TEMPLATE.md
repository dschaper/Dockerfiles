#### For bugs
- Rule Id (if any, e.g. SC1000): 
- My shellcheck version (`shellcheck --version` or "online"): 
- [ ] I tried on shellcheck.net and verified that this is still a problem on the latest commit
- [ ] It's not reproducible on shellcheck.net, but I think that's because it's an OS, configuration or encoding issue

#### For new checks and feature suggestions
- [ ] shellcheck.net (i.e. the latest commit) currently gives no useful warnings about this
- [ ] I searched through https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues and didn't find anything related


#### Here's a snippet or screenshot that shows the problem:

```sh

#!/your/interpreter
your script here

```
